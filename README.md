# \<multi-geo\>
Build composable, markup-based, extensible geo visualizations for the web. 

\<multi-geo\> (along with \<multi-chart\>) is a Polymer/Webcomponent library to compose markup-driven and data-driven geo vizualization layers.

## Motivation
While building vizualisation for the web, it is difficult to find the right balance between low-level vizualization kernel (like d3) that requires a lot of development work, and high-level black box library that are difficult to configure beyond a certain point. 

\<multi-geo\> is a attempt to provide the best of two the worlds: low level extensible webcomponents (often wrapper around d3.js modules like d3-axis) composed together to build complex charts. The library proposes ready-to-use configurable charts, but also the building blocks for accomodating more complex use case. 

\<multi-geo\>, plays well with [\<multi-chart\>](https://github.com/PolymerEl/multi-chart) (similar library for standart charts) and [\<multi-verse\>](https://github.com/PolymerEl/multi-verse), a graphical interactive multi-dimensional analysis tool. Together, they offer a markup based alternative to tools like [dc.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/)
